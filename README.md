# ðŸ’£Bang

*This is a fork of [unduck](https://unduck.link) by [Theo](https://github.com/t3dotgg/unduck).*

## Why fork?

This fork allows anyone to easily self host this service & add bangs for their own self-hosted websites. Bang comes pre-configured to work with

- Searxng *!s*
- Gitea *!tea*
- OpenWebUI *!ai*
- Nextcloud App Store *!cloudapp*
- Plex *!plex*
- Overseerr *!ov*
- Sonarr *!tv*
- Radarr *!mv*
- Lidarr *!mp3*

*Note: We have replaced some of the default bangs from duckduckgo with our own bangs in order to have more simple bangs for the self-hosted websites.*

You can also easily add your own bangs by adding a new entry in the bangs.ts file.

DuckDuckGo's bang redirects are too slow. Add the following URL as a custom search engine to your browser. Enables all of DuckDuckGo's bangs to work, but much faster.

```
https://bang.gbrown.org?q=%s
```

## How is it that much faster?

DuckDuckGo does their redirects server side. Their DNS is...not always great. Result is that it often takes ages.

Theo solved this by doing all of the work client side. Once you've went to https://unduck.link once, the JS is all cache'd and will never need to be downloaded again. Your device does the redirects, not me.
